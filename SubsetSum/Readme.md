As per the challenge:
Given a sorted list of distinct integers, write a function that returns whether there are two integers in the list that add up to 0.
For example, you would return true if both -14435 and 14435 are in the list, because -14435 + 14435 = 0. 
Also return true if 0 appears in the list.
